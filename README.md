# BD4H_group_project
The aim of this project is to reproduce the SRL-RNN paper titled "Supervised Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Network for Dynamic Treatment Recommendation".

Python 3.9 and numpy 1.21.5, pandas 1.4.4, sklearn 1.0.2, matplotlib 3.5.3, Keras 2.9.0 and TensorFlow 2.9.1 packages were used to run the code.

This repo includes the key queries used to preprocess the MIMIC-III data on BigQuery along with scripts used to impute and transform the data, the python code to run the SRL-RNN model and a basic LSTM model, as well as some sample data to run the model.

To test run the model, download the code and sample data, and put all of them in the same folder to run.
